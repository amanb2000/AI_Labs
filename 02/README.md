## Part I: Inference with Definite Clauses

__What is a Definite Clause?__ A *disjunction* (OR) of literals where only one literal is NOT negated (e.g., {!a || !b || c}).A

__What is Entailment?__ Whether or not a fact flows from another set of facts logically. I.e., whether or not set A entails proposition/sentence B.
