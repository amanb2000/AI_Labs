# Project 4: Reinforcement Learning

Maximum submissions: 20
Only need to deal with _template files_ `part*.py`.
Use test files before submitting to Autolab!

## Part 1: Value Iteration

`get_transition_model()`: Generates ttransition model for cleaning robot.
 - Should be a matrix (which axes do what?)

`value_iteration()`: Implement value iteration.
 - Input: states, actions, transition matrix, rewards, discount factor.
 - Output: _Epsilon-optimal_ policy + utility function for each state. 
	 - Epsilon = threshold for how much utility function should change (see pseudocode from textbook).
