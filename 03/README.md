# ROB311 Project 3

Focus: Decision tree learning, game-playing agents.
 - Implement basic decision tree learning with *greedy information gain* and *gain ratio splitting criteria* from lecture.
 - Build simple game-playing agent.

## Part I: Decision Tree Learning

 - What is data splitting in decision tree building?
 - What is information gain?
 - What is the gain ratio?
 - What is discrete entropy?
 - What is conditional entropy?
 - What is intrinsic information?
